**Introduction:**A web portfolio created in React and SASS. It has responsive design and multiple sections where I show who I am, my work and experience.

It has a backend on the SANITY platform, where data is brought dynamically to my portfolio so I have a control of the data in a decoupled way out of the frontend.
